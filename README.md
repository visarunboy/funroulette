# 🎡 Fun Roulette: What to Do?

A playful web app that decides **what to do next** — from watching a movie to meditating.  
Just spin the wheel and let fate choose for you!

## 🧠 How It Works
The wheel is drawn on an HTML5 canvas.  
Each slice represents a random activity idea — when you press **“Крутить!”**, it spins with physics-like deceleration and lands on one.
